# Fake-news-detection-using-ML-techniques
The Fake News Detection project represents a pivotal endeavor at the intersection of technology and societal well-being. In response to the alarming proliferation of misinformation, this project was undertaken to develop robust algorithms capable of discerning between authentic news articles and fabricated content. Leveraging machine learning techniques, including ternary classifiers such as Passive Aggressive, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine, the project aimed to address the nuanced challenges associated with fake news detection. It became evident that traditional array methods were inadequate for this task, prompting the integration of sophisticated machine learning algorithms.

The project's methodology involved a multifaceted approach, incorporating text-based processing and machine learning to analyze and classify news data. By utilizing techniques such as web scraping and Natural Language Processing (NLP), a comprehensive dataset was compiled for analysis. Through rigorous experimentation and evaluation, the project demonstrated promising results, with the implemented classifiers exhibiting accelerated performance in distinguishing between fake and genuine news articles.

One notable aspect of the project was the utilization of the Mixed Effects Random Forest (MERF) methodology, which enabled a nuanced exploration of global carbon emissions. By leveraging data from esteemed organizations like the World Bank and employing advanced modeling techniques, including MERF, the project contributed to the broader understanding of carbon dynamics and their implications for climate variability. This project underscores the critical role of data science in addressing pressing global challenges, such as climate change and misinformation, and highlights the potential of machine learning to drive meaningful societal impact.
